SILAS is a membership organisation managed by National Library Board of Singapore. At the moment, we have 37 member libraries, which include most of the public-funded libraries in Singapore. 

Our current core function is to provide cooperative cataloguing services to our member libraries. We use OCLC WorldCat Connexion Services to support this function. 

Through joining the Global cataloguing network, the holdings of our member libraries are updated in WorldCat and are exposed to the global users.
