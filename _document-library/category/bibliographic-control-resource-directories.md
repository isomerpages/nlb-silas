#### **Discussions**
**Kelley McGrath on RDA and MARC**
Kelley recently posted on the Internet this PDF entitled “Will RDA Kill MARC” (<https://pages.uoregon.edu/kelleym/KM_MWpresentation.pdf>{:target="_blank"}) (from ALA MidWinter 2011). This is a straightforward and easy to follow presentation on the limitations of MARC21, some of the benefits of RDA, and its shortcomings as well. Kelley gives us the added bonus of including her notes to each one of her slides. As a result, it’s easy to follow along and get a good sense of where’s she’s going. If you don’t know much about RDA or have been following along for some time, this is a good presentation to stop and read.
